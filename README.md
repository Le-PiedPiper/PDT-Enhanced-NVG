# PDT-Enhanced-NVG
 Custom NVG effects I made for my unit and decided to make public.

### See license for on that stuff
  The jist of it is do whatever you want 

### CBA Settings
CBA settings can be accessed through "Esc > Configure > Addon Option > Fawks' Enhanced NVGs". Note you have to be in-game or in the editor to change settings.

Setting                    | Value | Description
---------------------------| ------|------------
Use ACE color preset       | Yes/No| If you're using ACE it's recomended to turn this on; uses brighter colors for the effects
NVG Effect                 |Green Phosphern, White Phospher, MW Phospher| GB = no effect; WP = standard WP; MW = green-tint WP
Blacklisted NVG class names|Nothing| Pretty simple here, put the classnames of NVGs you only want to use GP.
