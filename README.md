# PDT-Enhanced-NVG
 Custom NVG effects I made for my unit and decided to make public.

### See license for on that stuff
  The gist of it is do whatever you want

### CBA Settings
CBA settings can be accessed through "Esc > Configure > Addon Option > Fawks' Enhanced NVGs".
Note you have to be in-game or in the editor to change settings.
If you change the NVG Effects while in using NVGs you will need to turn them off then backon again to upadate the effect.

Setting                    | Value | Description
---------------------------| ------|------------
Use ACE color preset       | Yes/No| If you're using ACE it's recomended to turn this on; uses brighter colors for the effects
NVG Effect                 |None, Green Phospher, White Phospher, MW Phospher, Amber filter| None = no effect; GB = better GP; WP = standard WP; MW = green-tint WP; Amber = Amber filter
Blacklisted NVG class names|Nothing| Pretty simple here, put the classnames of NVGs you only want to use GP.
